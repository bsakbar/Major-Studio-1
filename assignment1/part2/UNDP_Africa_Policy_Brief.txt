 CONTEXT  ENERGY ACCESS IN AFRICA\
  Access to energy is critical to Africa\'92s development and growth  Energy is the\
sustenance of all economies and an enabler of better welfare where there is a deficit in\
supply  this cripples economic growth and destroys livelihoods  Due to the urgent need\
to rapidly reduce carbon emissions and respond to the highly negative impact of climate\
change  there is a strong push towards promoting economic diversification and value chain\
development  accelerating access to energy in remote areas  and addressing the challenge\
of geographically complex terrain  all of which make expansion of access to renewable\
energy sources a development imperative \
   Sustainable Development Goal  SDG    of the      Agenda for Sustainable Development\
emphasizes the imperatives of achieving universal energy access through increases in access\
to renewable energy and improvement in energy efficiency  This is also a critical component\
of the Sustainable Energy for All  SE ALL  initiative of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral \
which was established in     This target is premised on the understanding that energy\
access  is critical to accelerate rapid economic growth  empower women  reduce poverty\
and improve living conditions \
   Access to energy in Africa is\
too low to meet development\
objectives  As of      four out of\
ten people in subSaharan Africa\
 SSA  have access to electricity \
compared to about nine out of ten\
globally  Also    of the world\'92s   \
largest energydeficit countries in\
    are in SSA   Furthermore  SSA\
accounts for    per cent of the global\
electricity access deficit  affecting\
    million people  Unless urgent\
actions are taken  this may increase\
to     million Africans without\
energy by      \
   Regional averages can mask a\
country\'92s specific context  Globally \
North African countries rank among\
countries with the highest levels of access to electricity  In all other African countries  except\
Mauritius  Seychelles  Gabon  South Africa  Ghana  and Cabo Verde   less than    per cent\
 Goal   of the SDGs is to be achieved through the following three targets  Target     By       ensure universal access to affordable \
reliable and modern energy services \'94 Target      By       increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix \'94\
and Target      By       double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency \'94\
  As defined by the International Energy Agency  IEA   energy access is a household having access to electricity and to a relatively clean \
safe means of cooking \
  In descending order  these countries are Nigeria  Ethiopia  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Tanzania  Uganda  Kenya  Sudan \
Mozambique  Madagascar  Angola  Malawi  Burkina Faso  Chad  Mali and South Sudan  The nonAfrican countries are India  Bangladesh\

of the population have access to electricity  In at least   African countries  less than    per cent of the population have access to electricity  see Figure    This notwithstanding  six of the ten African countries experiencing the fastest rates of growth in electricity access between     and     are Morocco  Cabo Verde  Botswana  Republic of the Congo  Ghana and Comoros  However  between      and      the seven fastest growing countries are Ethiopia  Kenya  Rwanda  Lesotho  Mozambique  Uganda and Chad while Djibouti and Zimbabwe regressed \
  \
There are real challenges to increasing energy access  but opportunities abound  The energy challenge in Africa is not limited to access  but also includes its quality  reliability  affordability and duration  The prohibitive cost of electricity is an impediment to access  Access to electricity is also concentrated in urban areas most hardtoreach rural communities are excluded  and urban slums often experience intermittent supply  For instance  only about  per cent of the rural populations  in ten African countries had\

access to electricity in       Overall  the shortage of energy is costing African economies an annual average of up to   per cent of its GDP  APP        i e  about US      billion in     current market prices  The inability of countries to keep up with population growth and limited political commitment to investment in the energy sector are among the factors explaining why SSA is experiencing a large energy deficit  The challenge of using energy access to mitigate climate change underpins the imperatives of renewable energy in closing Africa\'92s energy gap \
  \
Unless urgent actions are taken to scale up access to energy  it may become an overwhelming challenge to achieve SDG    This Policy Brief showcases UNDP\'92s efforts with national partners to facilitate and increase access to renewable energy  It also shows the potential for scaling up offgrid initiatives across the continent \
 \
AFRICA\'92S RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL\
  \
Africa has unique potential to scale up energy access to modernize agriculture rekindle industrialization increase jobs and reduce poverty and reduce exclusion  Due to the geographic landscape of African countries  particularly rural communities  access to the national grid is very difficult and expensive  Costeffective renewable energy therefore becomes the most effective solution to rural electrification in Africa  This solution unleashes the productive capacity of around twothirds of the population of many African\
  These countries are Central African Republic  Chad  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Djibouti  South Sudan  Burkina Faso  Guinea  Guinea Bissau  Liberia and Niger  IEA       \
By many measures  South Africa leads subSaharan Africa in generating renewable energy  yet dramatic increases must be made for the continent to meet the Agenda      goals  Source  Energy Intelligence\
Map    Renewable energy power plants in South Africa\
 \
countries  including South Africa  Nigeria  Ethiopia  Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya  For example  the recently signed Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme in South Africa is expected to create       jobs  \
  \
Good news  Over the past decade  the cost of providing electricity through renewable energy has decreased considerably and is becoming competitive with conventional energy sources such as coal  gas and oil  For instance  the cost of a solar home system dropped from      to     over the past five years   This emerging trend offers African countries real opportunities to be creative when increasing access to affordable and reliable energy utilizing decentralized energy sources will play a critical role  Further  forming partnerships with the private sector to identify and use optimal business models that help achieve affordable and reliable energy access will also be critical to achieving SDG   in Africa \
  \
Despite the declining cost of producing renewable energy  these renewable energy resources remain largely untapped in Africa  The potential for renewable energy cuts across most African countries   Box  presents the potential for Nigeria Box   for Ghana and Box   for Chad and Madagascar   Yet  their potential is enormous for transforming lives and livelihoods  and facilitating the achievement of the SDGs  Renewable energy offers the potential to quickly transform agricultural value addition  create decent jobs  mitigate the impact of climate change  improve the delivery of education and health care services  as well as transform livelihoods and living conditions in remote and rural communities  If access increases sufficiently  it will provide affordable  reliable and sustainable energy for all  thus helping to address poverty and leaving no one behind in the energy revolution  As the United Nations SecretaryGeneral noted recently  Energy is vital to our lives [\'85] Access to energy helps children to study at night  farmers to grow more crops and hospitals to provide better care \'94 \
  \
Africa\'92s population growth is creating imbalances between electricity demand and supply  leading to a rising energy deficit  SSA has not been able to keep up with an increased demand for access to electricity that has resulted from population growth  The number of people without electricity rose from about     million in      to     million in      World Bank        Good news  the pace of electrification tripled since      This made the population without access to electricity to fall to     million in      However  unless this effort is sustained and improved  this may rise to     million by       The recent improvement is based on increased investment and the realization that the traditional ongrid system does not work in Africa due to its topography and low population density and the remoteness of most of its villages and rural communities  Poor capacities for transmission and distribution make rural access to electricity very challenging  SSA has the highest number of countries with connection charges higher than    per customer at the lowest connection service rating  World Bank          Therefore  since most of the poor people live in rural areas  demand for electricity is very low due to low income and thus the supply of ongrid infrastructure is not commercially viable  Leveraging the opportunities of renewable energy in the context of geographically challenging areas and rising population rates is an imperative \

UNDP  through the Regional Bureau for Africa  RBA  is well positioned to play a leading role in helping to increase access to energy  RBA is operating in    countries on the African continent  more than    per cent of which have ongoing programmes in renewable energy  biomass  solar andor wind  Annex   Partnerships between UNDP and the Global Environmental Facility  GEF  have contributed immensely towards these programmes for example  between     and March            million was mobilized through them  Climate change adaptation as well as energy and infrastructure have the largest share of the resources  Figure     Through these partnerships    projects  totaling about     million  are being developed for submission for funding in     to the Green Climate Fund and  other projects are at the early stage of development  totaling about     million  \
  \
UNDP\'92s engagement in the energy sector in Africa covers the three main targets of SDG    renewable energy  energy access and energy efficiency  Given indoor pollution  which accounts for about     million deaths every year on the continent  about    per cent of UNDP\'92s energy portfolio between     and     was invested in energyefficient cookstove projects  UNDP\'92s portfolio in Africa covers       communities and      million people  ranging from        in Lesotho to        in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  It is also contributing to a reduction in carbon emissions of    million ton  ibid   \
  \
In Africa  the installed capacity of power plants and other installations that use renewable energy to produce electricity is low  at less than   per cent of the global total  compared to   per cent in Asia  However  there is a significant annual increase      per cent   which is comparable to Asia      per cent  and well above the global average      per cent   The areas on which UNDP focuses are catalytic  including  helping countries establish and enforce quality standards creating platforms to transfer knowledge  for learning and for incubation\

Box   UNDP\'92s efforts to help resolve the renewable energy paradox in Nigeria\
Nigeria\'92s energy access presents a paradox  In      the country flared     billion standard cubic meters  scm  of natural gas  about     per cent of daily production   translating to between US    million and US    billion during         Moreover  in Nigeria  the daily average of solar radiation is     MJm day   which is untapped for solar energy  which the Government projected to be as high as       MW  The country also has capacity to generate at least     MW of electricity from biomass and     MW from wind by       Yet  less than    percent of the population have access to electricity  Irregular energy supply leads to the proliferation of small diesel generators  which are more expensive than renewable energy and lead to noise and air pollution as well as health hazards \
UNDP contributes to harnessing untapped biomass and solar resources for energy access in many ways  Regarding biomass  UNDP efforts include supporting forestry management to balance demand for firewood  scaled up improved cookstoves to reduce deforestation in Delta and Kaduna States  and manufacturing efficient cookstoves in Bwari Local Government in Abuja  This partnership motivated the governments to distribute         clean cook stoves and       wonderbags in     alone  FGN        To address ecological problems such as deforestation and desertification  the National Clean Cooking Scheme  NCCS  aims to distribute over    millions of clean cook stoves by      \
Regarding solar energy  UNDP supported the following activities  the preparation of the National Energy Master Plan the development of offgrid solarPV for homes  street lighting and health delivery in   communities in North Eastern Nigeria and   villages in Bwari Local Government in Abuja the fabrication of solarpowered agroprocessing machines for women in Ebonyi  Nassarawa  Benue  Jigawa  Ogun and Kano States solar electrification in Edo State  Odighi and Ofetebe communities  and in Nasarawa State  Roguwa community   This includes training of youths for installation and maintenance of solar facilities \
Opportunities and lessons for transformation abound  These include  providing affordable marketbased solutions derisking the environment through matching grants strengthening the participation of value chain marketbased actors handson training adopting to fit local technology and practices promoting demanddriven initiatives  ensuring that renewable energy initiatives open up businesses for small and mediumsized enterprises  SMEs  and putting in place exit strategies  There is enormous opportunity for renewable energy in Nigeria due to a population of around    million without access to electricity and the abundance of untapped renewable energy resources including surface solar irradiance averaging about      kWhm  in the northern part of the country  The Government\'92s SE ALL Action Agenda aims at developing new biomass energy sources such as pellets  briquettes  biogas and liquid fuels  e g  ethanol  and create selfsustaining entrepreneurial network of rural microentrepreneurs for achieving this  UNDP is ready to accompany the Federal and State Governments and the private sector to achieve these goals \

UNDP\'92S LIFETRANSFORMING ENGAGEMENTS AND EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES\
  \
More countries are prioritizing renewable energy  The     Paris Climate Agreement has rekindled interest in investing in renewable energy  Further  as stated in the State of Electricity Access Report      global investment in renewable energy has more than doubled the investments in conventional energy sources since      and investment in developing countries outpaced those of developed countries  Indeed     out of the    countries that submitted intended nationally determined contributions  INDCs  emphasized the importance of renewable energy \
  \
The ambition from SubSaharan African countries  if backed up by actions  is very promising  For instance  Nigeria is targeting    electricity access by       using both grid extension and   gigawatts  GW  of offgrid solar photovoltaic  PV  Sudan is planning to provide   million solar home installations by      and Ghana aims to provide   million households with solar lanterns  IEA       \
  \
RBA advocates for leastcost energy solutions that mitigate risks and offer business opportunities  With predictable financing mechanisms  better planning  regulatory frameworks  enhanced coordination and enhanced technical skills  the cost of energy access can be affordable to the poor  UNDP\'92s approach is to advocate and promote the leastcost solutions that mitigate risks and offer viable business opportunities  In\
In Swaziland  biproducts of refining sugar are used to generate electricity\
 \
particular  in Africa  UNDP\'92s role is to advocate and promote the practices that could make universal energy achievable by       including building capacities of small and medium enterprises  \
  \
In addition to hydropower minigrids deployed in several African countries  e g  Democratic Republic of the Congo   Republic of the Congo  Central African Republic  Guinea  Lesotho and Malawi   UNDP also supported energy efficiency in several countries   e g  the support to    people in Rochama and Achada Church in Santa Cruz Municipality  Cabo Verde   UNDP\'92s measures to promote renewable energy access in Africa cover the following areas \
\
Advocacy  Piloting minischemes for stakeholders to appreciate the value of renewable energy and how imperative it is to help people build better lives  These schemes involve biomass  solar and wind energy \
\
Policy  Facilitating the development of a mixed national energy policy that emphasizes renewable energy  especially in countries with large  untapped renewable energy resources  This also entails contributing to the establishment of simple and clear rules for scaling up renewable energy including risk mitigation  and fiscal and market incentives that lead to winwin situations for beneficiaries  entrepreneurs and governments  This applies to most countries in which UNDP operates  e g  Chad  Cameroon  C\'f4te d\'92Ivoire  Ghana and Senegal   The engagement in these countries includes supporting governments to prepare national strategies and action plans on renewable energy \
\
Regulatory  Helping to facilitate nonobstructive and simple regulatory frameworks that guarantee standards and quality  products and services  that protect all segments of renewable value chains  including customers  Rwanda\'92s regulatory framework offers a good example the payment for environmental service scheme in Madagascar incentivizing the conservation of threatened species working with governments to prepare SE ALL implementation plan  e g  Tanzania  and Nigeria  and working with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on legal and regulatory framework on the energy sector \
\
Technical  Ensuring the transfer of technology to local operators  which is a panacea for sustainability  Technical skills that help provide quality power and meet future energy needs are key to success  Facilitating the training of local people to maintain and produce renewable energy helps develop entrepreneurship and job opportunities  UNDP\'92s operations in Angola  Chad  Kenya  Niger  and Nigeria offer good examples of this \
\
Financial  Ensuring commercial viability of renewable energy  especially among rural dwellers is vital to achieve universal energy access  Working with partners to promote longterm financial support in the form of loans  grants and subsidies incentivize private firms to invest in renewable energy and rural electrification  It is also important to promote lowcost solutions  To this end  the UNDP Nigeria  Bank of Industry  the RwandaDeutsche Gesellschaft f\'fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit  GIZ   and the Government of TanzaniaTanzania Investment Bank Renewable Energy Fund partnerships were established  \
  UNDP helped implement three microhydropower electricity plants between     and      Idjwi  Bitale  and Masisi  developed electricity legal and regulatory framework and improved cook stove and biogas fuel  UNDP\'92s interventions in the country  e g  North Kivu  South Kivu  Tshopo  etc  benefited       households \
 The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency  RURA  offers a    per cent subsidy on investments in privately owned and operated minigrids of up to    kW installed capacity  and those on isolated grids under    kW are exempted from licensing  see World Bank       \
  The Renewable Energy Fund of     per minigrid household connection  managed by the Tanzania Investment Bank is another\
 \
Box    UNDP\'92s efforts to promote access to renewable energy in Ghana\
Ghana is one of the few African countries with successful stories on electricity access  Between      and      its electricity access rate increased from    percent to    percent  thanks to the committed implementation of the     National Electrification Scheme and policies focused on rural communities \
Ghana has a high electricity access rate of over    per cent of the population  In the recent past  however  low water levels caused by droughts and unstable gas supply have led to load shedding  The policy goal is to increase the total installed capacity from       MW to       MW  and to increase share of renewable energy from    now to   per cent by      with a view to leveraging the country\'92s renewable energy potential  This is to be achieved through        MW of small and medium hydro power plants two million solar lanterns        solar home systems      MW of utilityscale biomass and waste energy capacity       MW of utilityscale wind and      MW of utilityscale solar capacity \
The potential for renewable energy is high  For instance  the country is estimated to have about       m  of biomass  which could generate over   megawatts  MW  of power  This source alone could create more than        direct jobs along the value chain  KNUST        Despite this robust opportunity  biomass cogeneration plants  which use sawmill residue and oil palm waste  have a total capacity of over   MW  AfricaEU RECP  n d    About       Ghanaians died annually from air pollution mostly due to   percent of the population relying on solid biomass for cooking  IEA        This among others revamped Government interest to accelerate access to improved cooking facilities \
The potential for wind and solar is even more  For instance  the average annual wind speed above    m is   ms and could be as high as     ms in certain locations  The monthly average solar radiation is between     and     kWhm day with sunshine duration between      and       hours per year  RVO        Several companies have started to leverage this potential for investment and business opportunities \
UNDP has worked with the Government in many areas to facilitate the achievement of its renewable energy target  The first area is helping to establish the regulatory framework that focuses on standards of efficiency and performance of cook stoves  The second is helping to promote technology transfer including the establishment of the renewable energy centre at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology  The third is piloting solar irrigation systems in deprived communities  And finally  UNDP has established the small grants mechanism to promote renewable energy technology transfer \
Regulations and standards  and their enforcement continue to be important lessons to be learned  An important opportunity for Ghana is solar energy  especially in the northern part of the country  which has a photovoltaic power potential of up to      kWhkWP  The implementation of a rooftop solar programme will be particularly useful  The development of minigrids  using a tested  optimally affordable business model  would be desirable  particularly for rural dwellers  Fiscal incentives include  exemption from import duties a feedintariff system access to a power purchase agreement and the establishment of a renewable energy fund \

Biomass iomass\
  \
Turning waste into energy increases access to electricity  stimulates smallscale business growth  and propels economic transformation  Based on available data  over    per cent of country offices in RBA countries with renewable energy programmes focus on improving biomass value chains  Notable examples include  transferring technology and delivering energyefficient technologies improving legislation and standards and sourcing of biomass  e g  forestry and landfills   Examples of UNDP projects include  smallscale bioenergy woodlots in Port Loko and Moyamba in Sierra Leone briquette technology in Kenya communitybased forest management in Angola the piloted biogas plant in Sengerema District in the United Republic of Tanzania  the biocoal Typha valorization project in Senegal and the cookstove testing and expertise lab in Ghana  See Box   on biomass potential in Ghana \
  \
There are enormous opportunities to significantly scale up biomass initiatives in most African countries  Rapid urbanization accompanied with serious shortages of effective and modern waste infrastructure in SSA makes the case more appealing for wastetoenergy or wealth initiatives  The presence of landfills in most cities and agricultural waste in rural areas creates further opportunities for similar initiatives \
   \
There are emerging opportunities to use waste feedstock to generate energy in Africa in commercial quantities  Some examples are  the Landfill Gas to Energy Project in  Johannesburg  South Africa Municipal Solid Waste Composting Project in Ikorodu and the Ketu Ikosi Biogas Project in Lagos  Nigeria the biogas plant at Kumasi Abattoir in Kumasi  Ghana the Pilot Biogas Initiative in Ferlo  Senegal the Gorge farm anaerobic digestion  AD  power plant in Naivasha  Kenya and the Koshe Waste to Energy Project in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia \
  \
UNDP is committed to maximizing opportunities for turning waste into energy in order to increase access to electricity  stimulate smallscale enterprise growth in the energy sector  and propel economic diversification and transformation  However  critical efforts must be undertaken to commercialize associated technologies in an affordable manner and ensure standardization for quality and safety \

Box    Renewable energy opportunities in Chad and Madagascar\
Madagascar  In      energy access reached   per cent of the population  of whom    per cent in the urban areas and   per cent in rural areas  The highlevel of deficit presents opportunities for expansion  The Government has set a target of    per cent energy access by      with solar and wind rising from about  to   per cent  The country is endowed with over     potential sites of small hydroelectric plants with a cumulative capacity of      MW an annual average of       kWhm  of solar radiation  photovoltaic potential  and wind power of    ms  To attract investors  the Government introduced a tax reduction of    per cent for renewable energy investments and exemption from duties and taxes on various renewable energy equipment  e g  PV panels  solar kits and  V batteries   To promote climate change mitigation  the environmental service scheme was introduced  This payment for environmental services  which is community based  helps to incentivize the conservation of threatened species \
Chad  Electricity in Chad is scarce  expensive and erratic in supply  As of      only     per cent of Chadians had access to electricity  The State of Electricity Report     rated Chad as the  th largest electricity access deficit globally  The per capita electricity consumption is one of the lowest in the world and tariffs are among the highest  Yet the photovoltaic power potential ranges from      to       kWhkWp annually from the south to the north  This can play a strong role in bridging the electricity deficit with solar alone having the potential to generate more than   per cent by       World Bank        The wind potential in the Central Region  for instance  could reach as high as      ms  UNDP\'92s engagement consists in strengthening regulatory frameworks  e g  helping to prepare the national strategy on renewable energy  energy coordination   facilitating access  e g  distributing cookstoves to       households  and promoting technology transfer and diffusion  e g  at least        people have learned better techniques for the use and manufacture of solar cookers   The opportunities for expanding solar energy production are significantly untapped  together with other renewable energy sources  such as biomass and wind  Enabling policy instruments to partner with the private sector provides the greatest opportunity to expand renewable energy in Chad \

Box    Solar lights up new hope for the remote Nyatsato Primary School  Zimbabwe and for health centres in Zambia\
Zimbabwe  Nyatsato Primary School is in Rushinga District  Mashonaland Central  about     km away from Harare few kilometers from Mozambique\'92s border  The lack of electricity in the school caused hardship for students and teachers alike  The installation of      kW power systems for lighting two school blocks  powering computer lab  as well as lighting  information sharing and entertainment  e g  TV and radio  for six teachers houses brought hope in      The school teaching and management staff were trained to be able to use and maintain the equipment \
The students use the classrooms at nights to read and have the privilege of being taught computer lessons while teachers complemented their studies using the light to study after school hours  The community has also expressed interest in taking literacy lessons after their children\'92s lessons are finished  The savings from nonpurchase of paraffin and candles because of the solar system is being contemplated for buying communal refrigerator and television \
Zambia  In cooperation with Innovation Norway and four private sector companies  UNDP led a pilot project to demonstrate how renewable energy improves quality and delivery of healthcare by installing solar power systems in   health facilities and Central Medical Store in Zambia  As a priority  the solar systems distributed energy to the most critical parts of the hospitals including emergency rooms  surgery  pharmacies  labs  vaccine refrigerators  and delivery rooms  Maternity wards received electricity    hours  seven days per week vaccines remained available and cold  A hybrid battery system  using leadlithium ion batteries  provides efficient storage  competitive unit costs  and an eightyear lifespan  The performance and usage of the system can be monitored offsite  For repairs  a remote repair\'94 scheme uses phone or Skype to provide technical assistance \
       beneficiaries  half of whom are children or women of child bearing age  received higher quality  reliable healthcare the number of consultations increased sharply  by between       as did access to vaccines  which are now stored onsite  Since the health facilities could now be open and operating during the night  the number of deliveries and emergency services increased dramatically as well \

Wind Energy \
   \
Africa is endowed with onshore and offshore wind energy  The wind capacity requirement for electricity generation varies from an annual average wind speeds greater than   meters per second  ms     mph  for small wind turbines and a minimum of   ms    mph  for utilityscale wind power plants  Tiyou        The African average is      ms  This ranges from below   ms  Gabon and Congo  Rep  of  to above   ms  Djibouti  Chad  and Kenya   See Figure   for wind power density potential for selected African countries compared to global leaders in installed capacities  UK  Canada  USA  China  Spain  Germany  and India  \
   \
Africa\'92s investment in wind energy is low  yet the potential benefits are high  Africa\'92s global share of the installed wind turbine capacity is very low  at     per cent compared to      per cent in Asia and the Pacific       per cent in Europe and Eurasia  and      per cent in North America  Figure     In spite of the high potential  the continent of Africa\'92s installed wind energy capacity is less than     per cent of China\'92s      per cent of the United States    per cent of Germany\'92s and    per cent of Brazil\'92s installed capacities  \

South Africa  the African country with the largest installed wind energy capacity  offers some lessons  Based on the objective of using renewable energy to further transform the economy structurally  wind projects were selected based on key criteria  pricing  job creation  local content policy and black economic empowerment  Wind energy project in South Africa is based on Public Private Partnership and has been adjudged as one of the best practices globally   Figure   presents wind energy installed capacity in Africa  When the ongoing constructions are completed in Africa\'92s leading countries  South Africa  Morocco  Egypt  Ethiopia  and Kenya   the collective installed capacity will reach     GW  The momentum to accelerate progress is high  For instance  Morocco is aiming     GW by      and Egypt targets     GW by       Tiyou        As is the case for solar  the gradual decrease of the cost of wind power generation is making it increasingly competitive relative to fossil fuels \
   \
UNDP support in wind energy is still nascent  see Annex    Kenya is one of the African countries boasting huge commercial wind energy production  In addition to the Ngong wind farm project  which contributes      MW to the national grid  the country is developing the largest wind power farm on the continent  the Lake Turkana wind farm  The South African Wind Energy Programme  SAWEP  is one of the ongoing wind projects on the continent  The Darling Wind Farm      MW  and the Klipheuwel Wind Farm      MW  are among the success stories in generating wind power on the continent   Other countries with wind energy potential should emulate Kenya\'92s and South Africa\'92s giant strides  This is an area where UNDP needs to consider scaling up capacity in line with emerging demand \
  As of      it had a total installed wind turbine capacity of     MW with another     MW in the pipeline and a target of       MW of wind capacity by       Tiyou       \

MICRO  SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES\
   \
UNDP is using renewable energy to drive innovation and entrepreneurial development in Africa  The renewable energy sector is creating opportunities for entrepreneurial development that could accelerate Africa\'92s economic expansion and transformation  Biomass  solar and wind power highlighted above provide opportunities for youth and women to develop skills and generate employment and livelihoods on the continent \
   \
Developing skills of local actors in renewable energy provides a critical component of the sustainability of renewable energy on the continent  Localization of renewable energy technology through adaptation  diffusion and maintenance is central for sustainability  These aspects create great opportunities for entrepreneurship  Even when such technologies are affordable  ensuring local maintenance of such facilities makes a substantial difference \
  \
UNDP is using emerging renewable energy to drive innovation on entrepreneurial development in Africa  Some illuminating examples are as follows \
 a \
In Kenya  in partnership with the Department for International Development  DfID  of the United Kingdom  UNDP is promoting the incubation of private firms through the Strengthening Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change in Kenya Plus  StARCK  and through the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund  which is helping to promote competition in the energy market \
 b \
In Ghana  the provision of subsidies to solar companies to derisk the renewable energy market is promoting the involvement of smallscale enterprises \
 c \
In Ethiopia  promoting technology roadshows  facilitating competitive schemes on rural energy technology  and providing business advisory services are the focus of partnerships with other actors \
 d \
In Togo  through the Emergency Community Programme  PUDC   entrepreneurs from micro and small enterprises are being trained to maintain and repair solar energy equipment \
 e \
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  UNDP facilitated the construction of three microhydropower plants in Idjwi  Bitale and Masisi  and mobilized the private sector in the construction of mini and microhydropower plants \
 f \
In Nigeria  through the buildownoperatetransfer  BOOT  business model  value chain actors  mostly youth and women  were trained  empowered  and certified as micro  small and medium enterprises  MSMEs  training focused on technical  financial  business and marketing skills to scaleup renewable energy \
 g \
In Chad  more than        people were trained on the techniques for manufacturing solar cookers and improved metal stoves \
 h \
In South Africa  emphasizing local content policy and the black economic empowerment as important criteria for selecting renewable energy projects is creating opportunities for entrepreneurial development \
 \
 \
LESSONS LEARNED\
   \
Regular access to electricity  especially in rural areas  enhances welfare  The experience in Africa has shown that energy access is a lifetransforming intervention  It enhances rural access to ICTs  e g  mobile phones and TV   lifecomforting appliances  e g  heating systems   refrigeration  including foods  drugs and vaccines   modern agriculture  solar pumping irrigation   direct and indirect income generating activities  repair and maintenance of equipment   and acts as a catalyst for value chain development  e g  multifunctional platform and industrialization   Energy also has developmental impacts  The use of fuel wood  which is as high as over    percent in the Gambia and Burundi  is a major cause of deforestation and a serious source of health hazards and deaths in Africa  Replacing this with improved cookstoves and lighting systems saves the continent from deforestation  reduces pollution and decreases health hazards  Improved energy access generates multiplier effects on the achievement of the SDGs \
   \
Affordability  scalability and sustainability are interlinked and need to be addressed together to produce synergistic results and impact  Lessons can be drawn from UNDP\'92s experience over the past decades in partnerships and support to renewable energy in Africa  Although affordability of renewable technologies remains a challenge in most parts of Africa  there has been a declining trend of renewable energy costs over the past five years  In addition  increasing economies of scale could further decrease prices considerably  Based on country experiences  upfront payment for renewable energy services is a good model for business continuity in rural areas \
   \
Scalability is limited because solar technologies are imported rather than developed in Africa  Investment in developing and assembling these technologies on the continent will enable opportunities to scale production and availability  It will also ensure that renewable energy becomes affordable and sustainable  UNDP\'92s partnership with domestic and external stakeholders will explore the possibility of facilitating production and assembling renewable energy infrastructure on the continent \
   \
Sustainability is key to achieving renewable energy\'92s maximum impact  Several factors contribute to the sustainability of renewable energy in Africa  The first is having national capacity for domesticating appropriate policy instruments  standards and regulations  These regulatory frameworks must be simple and clear  guarantee the quality of products and services  and protect all segments of renewable value chains  especially the customers  Second  community participation in the choice of business model and type of products not only ensures sustainability but also creates affordability  In Nigeria  lessons drawn from the cookstove initiative show that new tools must match cooking practices carried out at community level for successful outcomes  Indeed  sustainability is strengthened when the new tools align with local practices  Involving local actors in the design and management of renewable energy products matters  The joint venture approach imbedded in the recently signed Independent Power Purchase Agreement with South Africa provides illuminating examples South Africans hold      per cent of shares and local communities hold    per cent of shares  Radebe       \
 \
   \
UNDP must encourage MSME investments in renewable energy through effective financing schemes and helpful business strategies  Five key lessons emerge from UNDP\'92s experience in facilitating renewable energybased MSMEs in Africa  First  support to MSMEs must have a clear exit strategy  with clear roles and responsibilities in the form of a social contract  to avoid a dependency and entitlement syndrome  Second  ensuring access to competitive financial products and services is key  However  in rural areas  such products could be complemented with matching loans  funds  or partial money guarantees  The term \'91subsidy\'92 should be avoided because of past experiences  which tend to perpetuate dependency syndrome  Third  organizing MSMEs into platforms  networks and cooperatives to share experiences  knowledge  and lessons learned is vital for sustainability  Fourth  recognizing and rewarding successful entrepreneurs  including using innovative entrepreneurs as champions  help promote innovation and productivity  Finally  promoting technical partnerships between foreign and local firms will help develop entrepreneurship and skills that are suitable for transferring and diffusing technologies \
 \
CONCLUSIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PARTNERSHIPS\
   \
Stimulating universal access to renewable energy is essential to human and economic development  and catalytic to achieving all SDGs in Africa  yet renewable energy in Africa remains virtually untapped  Promoting energy access in Africa is not only beneficial to the continent but also an imperative for global growth and stability  For instance  efforts to reduce deforestation help to mitigate climate change globally boosting food production through solar irrigation systems  food refrigeration and reductions in food wastage help improve food security globally  Mobilizing global actors  governments  private sectors  foundations and international financial institutions  creates a winwin situation for Africa and the world  Accelerating access to renewable energy on the continent is not only an investment in Africa\'92s development  but also a global public good \
   \
Stimulating universal access to renewable energy will not only contribute to the achievement of SDG    but will also catalyse the achievement of all SDGs  In addition to helping transform lives through education and health services  e g  in Cameroon  Tanzania and C\'f4te d\'92Ivoire  and agricultural transformation  e g  solar irrigation in Ghana and Ethiopia   it contributes to creating jobs for youth and women  e g  Chad and Nigeria  and diversifying economies  e g  Kenya and South Africa   Yet  renewable energy in Africa remains virtually untapped  A similar trend pertains to biomass and wind energy  Helping build demand and increase installed capacities for renewable energy in Africa are imperatives for achieving the SDGs and Africa\'92s development agenda  The rising momentum to expand wind energy in South Africa  Morocco  Egypt  Ethiopia  and Kenya is commendable  UNDP and other development partners must help governments and other stakeholders to increase installed capacities of renewable energy in Africa \
   \
UNDP\'92s role and mandate to support access to energy in Africa is clear  to meet the Agenda      Goals  strong policy and partnership efforts must be implemented urgently  The alignment between UNDP\'92s Strategic Plan           with energy as one of the six signature solutions  and the focus on renewable energy by    out of the    countries that submitted INDCs shows a harmonization of priorities  A coordinated\
  \
partnership with UNDP offers opportunities to achieve synergy on SE ALL  the Climate Agreement and the SDGs \
   \
UNDP is committed to work with stakeholders to facilitate the development of practical solutions to close the electricity gap in Africa  Supporting stakeholders is important to create an enabling environment for reliable  affordable and sustainable access to energy  Such an environment must have the right policies  regulations and incentives for universal and sustainable access to achieve SDG   by      \
  \
UNDP\'92s contribution to renewable energy access in Africa is multidimensional  Annex and Boxes     First  facilitating partnerships  including publicprivate sector engagement and bilateral and multilateral collaboration on renewable energy in Africa is essential to UNDP\'92s mission  Specifically  partnering with the private sector to promote the development of optimal business models for affordable and reliable energy access is critical  Second  connecting domestic and foreign investors and promoting smallscale development  mentorship and entrepreneurship are important entry points  Third  it is important to work with various actors to identify and ensure viable business models on rural access to electricity and to ensure affordability  scalability and sustainability  Fourth  promoting social entrepreneurs  building local capacity for maintenance and repair of renewable equipment connects the renewable subsector to the rest of the economy  Fifth  UNDP is recognized for working with partners to develop policies  plans and strategies on renewable energy and in developing regulatory standards  Finally  working with African governments is needed to bridge the financing gaps through blended financing mechanisms  grants  marketbased loans and philanthropy \
