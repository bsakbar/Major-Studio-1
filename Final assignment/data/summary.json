			children’s school enrolment, attendance and completion. However, access remains unequal and the quality of education is a
			major issue in the region. UNICEF is working with governments to tackle constraints to the effective delivery of quality education
			services for all children.  Central to UNICEF's approach to strengthening education systems is improving the availability and use of data.
			UNICEF does this by advocating for the empowerment of schools to collect, analyze, monitor, and act on data to address equity, learning and system efficiency challenges.",
