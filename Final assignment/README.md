# Quality Education

**Description**

Obtaining a quality education in African countries is one of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. According to the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/), more than 265,000 children are out of school, and around 20% of them are in primary school age. Access to electricity is an important factor in order to achieve the SDG goal. This project studies the relationship between the country's access to electricity and the number of out–of–school children in primary and secondary school age.
